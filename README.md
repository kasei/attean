Attean Semantic Web Framework
=============================

Attean is a Perl framework for working with RDF data and SPARQL queries.
It features parsers and serializers for many different RDF formats including
RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples and N-Quads, as well as SPARQL formats like
SPARQL-XML, SPARQL-JSON, SPARQL-CSV and SPARQL-TSV.

Attean features support for SPARQL 1.1 queries, and a set of APIs and command
line tools to parse, transform, query, and serialize RDF data.
